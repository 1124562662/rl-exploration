Reinforcement Learning papers on exploration methods.

## Count-based

**Count-based exploration** is a category of exploration methods that encourage the agent to explore novel states by memorizing states' visitation counts.

## Novel behavior-based

**Novel behavior-based** is a category of exploration methods that encourage the agent to perform novel behaviors. Behaviors are specified by application-specific behavior-characteristic. For eg. distance traveled or speed of agent.

## Curiosity

**Curiosity-driven exploration** is a category of exploration methods that "generate an intrinsic reward signal based on how hard it is
for the agent to predict the consequences of its own actions, i.e. predict the next state given the current state and the executed
action." (Pathak et al., 2017)
